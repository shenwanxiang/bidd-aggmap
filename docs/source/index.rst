Jigsaw-like aggmap: A Robust and Explainable Multi-Channel Omics Deep Learning Tool
===========================================================================

aggmap package is developed to enhance the learning of the unordered and unstructured omics data. aggmap includes theree major modules, they are:

- **AggMap**: an unsupervised novel feature aggregation tool, which is developed to Aggregate and Map omics features into multi-channel 2D spatial-correlated image-like feature maps (Fmaps) based on their intrinsic correlations.
- **AggMapNet**: a simple yet efficient CNN-based supervised learning model, which is developed for learning the output structured Fmaps of AggMap .
- **Explainers**: the model explaination modules (Shapley-explainer and Simply-explainer), which are developed to calculate the local and global feature importance, and based on the 2D-grid of AggMap, we can generate the explaination saliency-map based on the the feature importance score 


The details for the underlying mathematics can be found in
`our paper on NAR <https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/50/8/e45/6517966>`_:
