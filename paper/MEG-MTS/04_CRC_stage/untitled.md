We found two distinct patterns of microbiome elevations. First, the relative
abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum spp. was significantly (P< 0.005) elevated continuously from intramucosal carcinoma to more advanced stages. 


Second, Atopobium parvulum and Actinomyces odontolyticus, which co-occurred in intramucosal carcinomas, were significantly (P< 0.005) increased
only in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas.
